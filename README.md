# AWS EKS Infrastructure & App Deployment with Terraform

## Overview
Deployment of an application AWS EKS with a frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL database.
Focus is on infrastructure over app complexity.

## Pre-requisites
1. Terraform
2. Python 3.8+
3. AWS CLI installed and configured

## Components
- Frontend: A simple React app webpack + nginx
- Backend: A simple Java http server
- Database: PostgreSQL

## Services used
Amazon EKS, Amazon RDS, AWS Secrets Manager, Amazon VPC, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon EC2, AWS KMS, AWS CloudWatch

## Architecture

1. Networking (VPC)
    - Public Subnets: Host NAT Gateway, ELB for frontend
    - Private Subnets: Host EKS nodes (pods), RDS
    - NAT Gateway: Outbound internet access for private subnets

2. Compute (EKS)
    - 2 `t3.micro` nodes, each 4 pods.
    - Pods `aws-node` (2), `kube-proxy` (2), `coredns` (1), `backend` (1), `frontend` (1)

3. Storage (RDS)
    - PostgreSQL in private subnets, secured by SG.

4. Secrets (Secrets Manager)
    - Stores DB credentials

## Flow
Browser -> `frontend-external-ip` -> ELB Routes the inbound traffic from the internet to the frontend pods in private subnets -> Nginx serves the UI and proxies to `backend-service` -> Backend writes to RDS -> RDS Stores the data with encryption at rest



## Some of the problems faced during development with solutions applied
1. `FATAL: password authentication failed` - Secrets Manager and RDS password diverged 
 - Even if you set a password in RDS module, it uses its own managed password; in this case, I used master password (temporarily) then set `manage_master_user_password = false` to use pre-defined credentials for a while. However, that breaks credential rotation. With that concern, later I set `manage_master_user_password = true` again.
2. Pod capacity limit `t3.micro` 4-pod limit blocked frontend pod init (pending state)
 - Scaled to 2 nodes
3. Security group misconfiguration initial `main.tf` omitted `node_security_group_id``
 - Included node SG for pod-to-resource traffic in EKS
4. CORS error `fetch('http://backend-service:8080')` failed CORS
 - Nginx proxy `/sum` in frontend pod
5. Initial EKS cluster started at Kubernetes 1.28 caused unexpected cost increase due to extended support
 - Updated cluster version to 1.29 first then 1.30
6. Terraform is great at creating resources, but not the best at deleting/cleaning-up those resources
-  Terraform is not able to delete dynamically externally created security groups and resources. Went into the AWS console and delete the same resource myself. I found out that this happens for VPC. Later, i added some bash scripts in util folder `delete-elbs.sh`, `delete-security-groups.sh`, `delete-detached-enis.sh`. This got easier after enabling feature flags (`enable_xyz_module = true/false`) in tfvars. Since I can use `terraform apply` instead of `terraform destroy` to destroy modules. 
7. Install postgresql on AL2
- sudo yum update
- sudo yum search "postgres"
- todo: use user data to install postgresql or save ami

8. RDS Query Editor limited to Aurora services
- no solution yet, try migrating the database to aurora
9. `Error syncing load balancer: could not find any suitable subnets``
- EKS indetifies its associated subnets by looking for tags with cluster name. Make sure they match.
`    "kubernetes.io/cluster/${var.cluster_name}" = "shared" `

## Useful Snippets

### Connecting local `kubectl`to EKS
`aws eks update-kubeconfig --name ce-task-prod-eks-cluster --region eu-central-1`

### Getting the external IP for LB
`kubectl get svc frontend-service -o wide`

### Getting HPA status
`kubectl get hpa backend-hpa -n default`

### Getting pod cpu and memory usage
`kubectl top pods -n default`

### Displaying security groups
`aws ec2 describe-security-groups --region eu-central-1 --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=vpc-07b0d74b5ac63daa0`

### Checking Terraform logs
`export TF_LOG=DEBUG`
`terraform destroy 2>&1 | tee destroy.log`
